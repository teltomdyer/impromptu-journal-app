# impromptu-journal
###### A place to journal immediately. Just tap and type. Keeps entries and tracks when and where they were written.

### Motivation
When inspiration strikes it sucks to have to find a notebook, open google drive, make yet another random note in your 
iphone, only for the idea to get lost in the sea of snippets you write and don't keep track of.

Instead this project is aimed to create an app where you just have to tap, type, then exit. The app will keep track of 
the journal entry, when and where it was written, without any hassle or management from the user.

### Why this is an excellent project for the class
1. This project is simple to implement with a relational or non-relational db.
2. There isn't a lot of tricky technical work to be done, so we can get to the meat of the project quickly. (Good size for class)
3. We can implement this with whatever tech stack we decide is best and the ones suggested below are easy to use.

### Tech stack
###### Relational Database Options
* postgreSQL
* mySQL

###### No SQL Database Options
* mongo
* firebase RTD (has easy to work with sdk for react native or android)

###### Frontend Options
* React native (Works on iOS or Android)
* Android (Java)

### Team
This project would work best with 2-3 people. 1-2 on backend 1-2 on frontend.

### Business
This would be a free app with a premium paid version 

### Legal
This would be strictly for a school project with no actual value created during the semester and ownership
of the idea staying with me. (Although I don't know or care how someone wouldn't be able to just copy the idea later)
